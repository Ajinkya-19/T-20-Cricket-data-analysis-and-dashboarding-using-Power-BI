this project is focused on craete best 11 based on the players weakness and Power.The objective of this project is to assemble the best 11-player team for T20 World Cup. Comprehensive insights from the 2022 T20 World Cupvdata are required to make informed decisions on player selection.

In this project I scraped data from the ESPNcricinfo website
using Bright Data, transform and clean the data with pandas, and created
a detailed dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard will help in identifying
the best-performing players.



## ðŸ›  Skills
Python,Pandas,Numpy,PowerBi,webscraping, Data collection,Data Preprocessing,Deeper analytical mindset
## Working
 In this section I Describe the working of the project.
    1) convert the json file into data frame then performing data preprocessing and data cleaning process on them.|
    2) convert the data set int csv file and open into Power-Bi software.
    3) In power query section performing data cleaning once again and the in Dax section create data modelling which shown below.
    4) at last stage carete a Report based on the condition, in Which create best 11 from dimplayer, batsman, Ballers, Allrounders.


## Condition 
For Create best 11 from more than 500-600  players I decided some Conditions for Team, Openrs, middle orders batsman, Lower order Batsman tail enders, fast Ballers etc.
# Team
1.The team should be able to score at
least 180 runs on an average.

2.They should be to defend 150 runs
on an average.

|Dot Ball % |% of dot balls bowled |> 40|

## DAX Formulas

To  finalised the best 11 in Power bi I created some Dax Formulas but I provide some of the formulas . I will provide the list of formulas in repository.
|Sno|	Measures|	Description / Purpose|	DAX FORMULA|
|:---|:---------|:-----------------------|:-----------|
|1|	Total Runs|	Total number of runs scored by the batsman|	Total Runs = SUM(fact_batting_summary[runs])|	
|2|	Total Innings Batted|Total number of innings a batsman got a chance to bat|	Total Innings Batted = COUNT(fact_batting_summary[match_id])|	
|3|Total Innings Dismissed|To find the number of innings batsman got out|SUM(fact_batting_summary[out])	|
|4|Batting Average|	Average runs scored in an innings|	Batting Avg = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[Total Innings Dismissed],0)|	
|5|Strike Rate|	No of runs scored per 100 balls|	Strike rate = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[total balls faced],0)*100|
