this project is focused on create best 11 based on the players weakness and Power.The objective of this project is to assemble the best 11-player team for T20 World Cup. Comprehensive insights from the 2022 T20 World Cupvdata are required to make informed decisions on player selection.

In this project I scraped data from the ESPNcricinfo website
using Bright Data, transform and clean the data with pandas, and created
a detailed dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard will help in identifying
the best-performing players.

## Working
 In this section I Describe the working of the project.
    1) convert the json file into data frame then performing data preprocessing and data cleaning process on them.
    2) convert the data set int csv file and open into Power-Bi software.
    3) In power query section performing data cleaning once again and the in Dax section create data modelling which shown below.
    4) at last stage carete a Report based on the condition, in Which create best 11 from dimplayer, batsman, Ballers, Allrounders.


## Condition 
For Create best 11 from more than 500-600  players I decided some Conditions for Team, Openrs, middle orders batsman, Lower order Batsman tail enders, fast Ballers etc.

## DAX Formulas

To  finalised the best 11 in Power bi I created some Dax Formulas but I provide some of the formulas . I will provide the list of formulas in repository.
|Sno|	Measures|	Description / Purpose|	DAX FORMULA|
|:---|:---------|:-----------------------|:-----------|
|1|	Total Runs|	Total number of runs scored by the batsman|	Total Runs = SUM(fact_batting_summary[runs])|	
|2|	Total Innings Batted|Total number of innings a batsman got a chance to bat|	Total Innings Batted = COUNT(fact_batting_summary[match_id])|	
|3|Total Innings Dismissed|To find the number of innings batsman got out|SUM(fact_batting_summary[out])	|
|4|Batting Average|	Average runs scored in an innings|	Batting Avg = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[Total Innings Dismissed],0)|	
|5|Strike Rate|	No of runs scored per 100 balls|	Strike rate = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[total balls faced],0)*100|
